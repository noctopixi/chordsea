      <h1>About Chordsea</h1>
      <hr/>
      <h2>what is it?</h2>
      <p>Chordsea is a minimalist chord progression generator. It is written using Python and Flask.</p>
      <p>This is the web version. For a minimalist experience, you can also run chordsea and get ASCII tabs right in your terminal.</p>

      <h2>why is it?</h2>
      <p>When practicing guitar chord changes, I felt like I often went for the "safe", obvious pairs that I was comfortable with, and realized that I'd need a randomized practice that challenged and pushed me out of my comfort zone.</p>
      <p>I had recently learned about the <strong>random</strong> Python module and decided to implement a guitar chord randomizer that I could run in my terminal.</p>
      <p>I decided to create the web version to learn Flask and to make chordsea accessible to anyone who wants an easy solution to generate practice sessions for chord changes.</p>
